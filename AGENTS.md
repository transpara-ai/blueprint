# Working in Blueprint

Blueprint encodes world-class software engineering and agentic engineering practice: design when architecture is ambiguous, spec when implementation contracts or invariants matter, plan when work needs splitting, test before ship, refactor when code needs simplifying, review before merge, drive PR feedback to merge-ready with judgment.

If you are an AI agent working in this repo, follow this guidance.

## The Three Flows

Blueprint has three flows. The handoff between them is a project skeleton, spec, or task with acceptance criteria.

**Setup** (`bootstrap-project`): turn a new or empty repo into a clean local starting point with README, license, `.gitignore`, `AGENTS.md`, and docs. Interview the repo creator only when file-changing decisions are unclear; commit or push only when explicitly asked.

**Decide** (`design-doc` -> `spec` -> `plan`): turn ambiguity into reviewed decisions and agent-sized tasks. Every stage pauses for human review. Start at `design-doc` when architecture, alternatives, or tradeoffs are ambiguous. Use `spec` when implementation requirements, contracts, invariants, or error behavior need review. Use `plan` when the work just needs splitting. Skip stages when the change is trivial and decision-complete.

**Deliver** (`task-to-pr`): turn one task into a draft PR with the ticket as the audit trail. `task-to-pr` runs workspace preparation -> `implement` -> review subagent -> acceptance-verification subagent -> `pr`, preferring worktrees when isolation reduces risk. Use `multitask` to run several independent tickets in parallel, one isolated worker per ticket. Use `pr-to-ready` once feedback exists to drive the PR to merge-ready; merging is always a human decision. Use `implement` alone when the workspace is prepared and no PR is expected, `tdd` when a failing test can describe the behavior first, `refactor` to tidy the changed code before review, and `debug` when something breaks.

Exploration is allowed without creating docs or issue tracker entries. Do not manufacture fake specs, plans, or issues for spikes.

## Skills

Decide:

- `bootstrap-project`: bootstrap a new or empty repository with clean docs, license, and agent guidance.
- `design-doc`: write a lightweight architecture design doc when architecture or tradeoffs are ambiguous.
- `spec`: write implementation requirements, contracts, invariants, and error behavior before coding.
- `plan`: break a spec, brief, or request into agent-sized tasks.
- `goal-design`: turn rough objectives into Codex or Claude Code `/goal` prompts with clear checks, evidence, and stop rules.

Deliver:

- `task-to-pr`: orchestrate one ticket to a draft PR, keeping the ticket updated with evidence; uses isolated branches/worktrees, tests, review, and acceptance verification.
- `multitask`: run several tickets to draft PRs in parallel, one isolated worker per ticket; composes task-to-pr.
- `implement`: turn one scoped task into a verified diff with tests.
- `tdd`: test-first variant of implement.
- `debug`: find the root cause of a failure, then fix it with a regression test first when practical.
- `refactor`: simplify changed code without changing behavior.
- `review`: pre-merge code review for correctness, security, simplicity, robustness, and tests.
- `pr`: commit, push, and open a PR with a clear description.
- `pr-to-ready`: drive an open PR with feedback to merge-ready; never merges.
- `browser-verify`: verify browser-rendered work in a real browser.

Helper entry points:

- `branch`: create a traceable Git branch with the ticket ID when available.
- `commit`: stage intended changes and write one clear Conventional Commit.

## Agents

- `code-reviewer` (`agents/code-reviewer.md`): fresh-context adversarial reviewer. The subagent that `implement` and `task-to-pr` should use for their fresh review step when agent definitions are installed.

## Running Unattended

Blueprint can run as scheduled loops over an issue tracker, with agents filing every issue. Three phases:

1. **Ready**: turn ideas and specs into agent-ready issues. The agent filing an issue judges it at creation: decision-complete work gets `agent:ready`; a real problem with open decisions gets `needs:spec`. Nothing unjudged enters the tracker.
2. **Work**: a scheduled agent claims one `agent:ready` issue and runs `task-to-pr` to a draft PR.
3. **Review**: humans, review bots, and checks leave feedback. A review-watch loop runs `pr-to-ready` after a short grace window, repeats until ready or blocked, and a human merges.

### Definition of Ready

An issue is agent-ready when a fresh agent could finish it without asking questions:

- Goal stated as an outcome, not an implementation.
- Enough context to execute with no prior session.
- Testable acceptance criteria.
- A concrete, runnable verify step.
- Decision-complete: no open product or design decisions.

### Labels

Namespaces separate dimensions: `agent:*` is the state machine, `needs:*` is what an issue waits on, `risk:*` and `type:*` are metadata set when the issue is filed.

- `needs:spec`: real problem, open decisions. The spec loop picks it up.
- `agent:ready`: meets the definition of ready. The work loop claims it.
- `agent:working`: claimed by a worker. A claim with no linked branch or PR activity after 24 hours is stale; release it back to `agent:ready`.
- `agent:complete`: PR open, awaiting feedback or merge. The work loop's throttle counts these.
- `blocked`: waiting on another issue, linked in the body. Remove when the blocker closes.
- `needs:human`: an agent hit a decision only a human can make, explained in a comment.
- `risk:low` / `risk:high`: blast radius if the work goes wrong, judged at filing. Unattended loops claim `risk:low` only.
- `type:feature` / `type:bug` / `type:chore`: optional classification for reporting; not part of the loop.

Humans flip `needs:spec` to `agent:ready` after spec review, review PRs when judgment is needed, and merge. Agents do everything else. Full label reference: `guides/labels.md`. Setup and sample prompts: `guides/loops.md`.

## Guidance

- Design docs default to `docs/<design-slug>/design.md`.
- One spec per feature, at `docs/<feature-slug>/spec.md`.
- Specs are durable; plans are transport. A plan goes to exactly one destination: tracker issues when the user asks or the repo runs an unattended loop, `docs/<feature-slug>/plan.md` when there is a feature directory, chat otherwise.
- If the task, spec, or plan is wrong, stop and update it. Do not push through.
- Tests are the verification mechanism; review checks they are real.
- Density over length.

## Out of Scope

Blueprint is not an issue tracker, architecture review board, or release process. It turns external context into high-quality instructions for coding agents. That's the entire job.
